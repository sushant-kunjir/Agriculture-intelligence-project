#  Agriculture Intelligence Dashboard (AWS + Snowflake + Power BI)

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural performance across multiple dimensions such as **locations, seasons, crop types, irrigation methods, rainfall, temperature, soil types**, and **overall productivity**.

The dashboard helps identify patterns in:
- Yield performance  
- Climate behavior (rainfall & temperature)  
- Humidity variations  
- Irrigation usage  
- Region-wise agricultural activity

## 🔹 Tech Stack & Tools Used

### **AWS**
- **S3** – Used for storing raw CSV files in a secure cloud environment  
- **IAM** – Configured access roles, external authentication ID, and trust policies for secure Snowflake–AWS integration  

### **Snowflake**
- Used as **data warehouse**
- Configured **storage integration** with AWS S3
- Executed **Snowflake SQL** for:
  - Data cleaning  
  - Transformations  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Schema design  
  - Creating analytical datasets for Power BI  

### **Power BI**
- Used **Power Query** for shaping & additional transformations  
- Built **multi-layer dashboards** with advanced navigation  
- Applied **custom themes** for clean & consistent visuals  
- Used **Bookmarks** to switch between charts dynamically  
- Designed **KPI cards, maps, line charts, bar charts, pie charts**, and interactive slicers

## 🔹 What You’ll See Inside the Dashboard

- **KPI Cards** – Total Yields, Total Area, Avg Rainfall, Avg Temperature  
- **Line Chart** – Year-wise temperature trends  
- **Bar Chart** – Irrigation method distribution (Drip, Basin, Spray)  
- **Pie Chart** – Humidity by season (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid)  
- **Map Visual** – Agricultural activity distributed across major locations  
- **Crop Yield Comparison** – Year-wise yield performance (Y1, Y2, Y3)  
- **Slicers** – Location, Crop, Year, Season, Soil Type, Irrigation
